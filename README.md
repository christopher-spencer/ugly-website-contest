# Ugly Website Contest 

- A mini project made with HTML and CSS that was created for an Ugly Website Contest.
- The purpose of this contest was to have some good fun and reflect on how to improve CSS styling choices in the future by intentionally studying and reflecting on misguided design concepts.
- This ugly website, called "Horsey Time," features mind-numbingly bad rotating animations with little to no point, and a form that is impossible to fill out.
